1. Checkout local branch and make sure it is tracking branch and has corresponding remote branch. Use 
	git branch -vv for check
	
	2. Enter 
	git pull
	
	3. Git will Fetch all changes from remote repository
	git fetch
	4. is executed in background
	
	5. After fetching Git updates FETCH_HEAD file that contains SHA1 hashes of last commits in remote repository for all tracking branches
	
	6. Git merges remote branch into current branch
	git merge FETCH_HEAD
	
NO: if both remote & local branches were changed Git applies 3-way merge, But if only remote branch was changed Git applies fast forward merge
